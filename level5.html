    <h1 id="greeting"></h1> To be honest, I used chatGPT to try to understand it, but it made me relize little bit how this work 
                            You have this h1 ID, which is empty and then in the Script tag, the document.getElemetById("greeting")
                             finds the HTML element with The ID "greeting". innerHTML puts the text in "hello world"

    <!- -
    Now comes the first thing we have never seen before, namely TypeScript.
    Try to read it and guess what it does, write in a comment what you think it will do
    Next use Google, ChatGPT and/or Claude to find out what it does.
    write in another comment what it actually does and see if it is far from what you thought it did
    - ->
    <script>
        document.getElementById("greeting").innerHTML = "Hello, world!";
    </script>
</body>
</html>
